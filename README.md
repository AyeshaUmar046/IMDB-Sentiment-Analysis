# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis

Beginner-friendly sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews using Logistic Regression.
Includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and predictions with visuals.


# Steps Performed  

1. **Data Loading & Extraction**

  Uploaded IMDB dataset (CSV inside ZIP).
  
     
  Extracted and loaded into Pandas dataframe.  
  

3. **Data Preprocessing**
 
   Converted labels (positive/negative â†’ 1/0).


   Lowercased text, removed HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords.


   Created a clean text column for analysis.
   

5. **Feature Engineering**
   
    Used **CountVectorizer** with unigrams and bigrams (max 5000 features).
   

7. **Model Training**
   
   Split data (80% training, 20% testing).
  
     
   Trained **Logistic Regression** classifier.
     

9. **Evaluation**
    
    Accuracy score.

    
   Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score).

   
    Confusion matrix visualization.
   

11. **Predictions**

    Function to predict sentiment of new reviews.

    
    Tested on custom example sentences.

## Key Insights  

Logistic Regression achieved high accuracy on test data.  


Most misclassifications occurred between slightly positive/negative reviews.  


Text preprocessing (removing stopwords, cleaning) improved performance.  


## Tech Stack 

 **Python**
 

**Pandas, NumPy**


**Scikit-learn**

 
  **Matplotlib**  


## ðŸ“Œ How to Use  

Upload `IMDB Dataset.csv.zip` in Google Colab.


  
 Run the notebook cells step by step.

 

Try the prediction function with your own movie reviews.
